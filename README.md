### Installing the environment

I recommend using python 3.7 or higher.

Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Please take care with the `fast.ai` library version - it's under rapid development and version changes may require fixes in the example.

### Getting the exact pre-trained model from the exercise

Follow lesson3-imdb from the [fast.ai] course and use the saved model, or get in touch with me and I'll share it with you.
